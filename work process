h: You can try the result that the line becomes wider and the probability of random discarding on both sides of the axial direction of the line symmetry gradually increases.
r: Okay, so now we're going to add the noise point clouds to the Gaussian distribution, and we're going to add the sea power broadening.
h: The point cloud on the outer facade seems to have a high density in the middle and a low density on both sides.
r: The same is true of the Gaussian distribution, which may not be visually significant due to the std setting.
h: Mm-hmm
r: Is there a way to make adjacent locations a little less likely?
h: Distance between points and points conversion between pixels and distance between pixels
r: I'll be at the meeting. We'll talk about it sometime.
h: - Okay. - Okay.

Ren Jie meeting:
each point in the figure should represent 0.2meter * 0.2 meter
we should consider the point density on the building edge to be 20-100 points / meter2
and point density inside of the building should be 5-10 points/meter2
let's consider 512*512 pixels in a picture

each point in the figure should represent 0.1meter * 0.1 meter
which means 1 meter square = 100 pixels
requriement no.1 keep size fixed as 512*512
requirement no.2 add 2 hyper-parameter in your simulator, which is 1. the point density near the edges and 2. the point density inside the building
for example, areas which is not 1 meter away from the edge can be defined as edge area, and 1 meter away from the edge and inside the building can be defined as internal area
